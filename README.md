# Greetings
My name is Lukas Sondell but I'm usually referred to as Sondelll on the internet.
You can normally find me knee deep in obscure dev projects
or possibly doing some elaborate media production,
I definitely like variation.

## Starting off
I did some C# through building small game-like stuff in Unity,
I later expanded to C++ and Python.
After spending a few months hammering in Javascript and subsequently Typescript, I've picked Python back up to play around with machine learning.


## Currently working on:
* Mama Goose - A game about an unlikely hero
* Crokket - An offline-only solution for audio transcription

## Contact
If you want to reach out, I'm reachable through Discord, feel free:
* Sondelll#0001
