# Greetings
Iâ€™m the certified maniac commonly referred to as Sondelll.
You can normally find me knee deep in obscure dev projects,
or possibly doing some elaborate media production,
I like to get around.
## Starting off
I did some C# through building small game-like stuff in Unity,
I later expanded to C++ and Python.
I'm currently building my first fullstack (MERN) webapp prototype.


## Currently working on:
### Iteration 5 or higher:
* Splinterr - A SCADA-like solution for a proprietary residential heating system
* G2 Bygglauv - A webapp prototype for submitting building permits. (University course)

### In early stages:
* return false; - An entertainment project, https://linktr.ee/returnfalse/
* StudEff - A tool for dealing with the everlasting struggle of keeping up to date with higher education studies.

## Contact
Not that I see why it would be of interest, but I'm reachable through Discord,
* Sondelll#0001
