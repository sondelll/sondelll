# Greetings
My name is Lukas Sondell but I'm usually referred to as Sondelll on the internet.
You can normally find me knee deep in obscure dev projects
or possibly doing some elaborate media production,
I definitely like variation.

## Starting off
I did some C# through building small game-like stuff in Unity,
I later expanded to C++ and Python.
After spending a few months hammering in Javascript and subsequently Typescript, I've returned somewhat to C# for my work on the Unity-based game Mama Goose at Not A Duck Studios.


## Currently working on:
* Mama Goose - A Unity game about an unlikely hero
* formula-predict - A machine learning package to predict outcome of F1 races based on available data.

## Contact
If you want to reach out, I'm reachable through Discord, feel free:
* Sondelll#0001
