# Greetings
Iâ€™m the certified maniac known as Sondelll (yeah, 3 L's).
You can normally find me knee deep in obscure dev projects,
or possibly doing some elaborate media production,
I like to get around.
## Starting off
I did some C# through building small game-like stuff in Unity,
I later expanded to C++ and Python.
I'm currently getting familiar with NodeJS.
I want to mess around with some PHP, but I can never seem to find the time.

## Currently working on:
* Splinterr - A stacked monitoring solution for residential heating    
* TimeVis - Data visualization from university schedules, made for use with API, testing with scraped data.    
* return false; - An entertainment project, https://linktr.ee/returnfalse/

## Contact
Not that I see why it would be of interest, but I'm reachable through Discord,
* Sondelll#0001
