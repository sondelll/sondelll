# Greetings
My name is Lukas Sondell but I'm often simply referred to as Sondelll.
You can normally find me knee deep in obscure dev projects
or possibly doing some elaborate media production,
I definitely like variation.

## Currently working on:
* \_V2 - A media pipeline using diffable text for version control   
* Crokket - An offline-only solution for audio transcription

## Contact
If you want to reach out, I'm reachable through Discord, feel free:
